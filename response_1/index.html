        <p>Question 01: The author has mentioned "The blogroll, often presented in reverse chronological order, encourages an additive presentation reliant on constant updating and thus more dependent on tags to create connections between newer posts and the older ones that may disappear down the site." on 4th page, second paragraph. Does index-exhibit really encourages the addictive post and presentation of the "artists/art markets"? If there is no internet based exhibit, would the artist stop theirs artistic movements in the physical world?</p>
        <p>Question 02: Does a medium such as website, blog, instagram account really mean to be an exhibit place for artist? Or it's just a gateway for them to be known by audiences?</p>
