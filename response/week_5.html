    <h1>Reading Response 5: Fuck Content</h1>
		<p><b>Question 01:</b> The author has argued Paul Rand's "There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form." while mentioned "Designers also trade in storytelling. The elements we must master are not the content narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale, weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines." Does the author mean that designer could telly the story/content via the form of it?  
		       <br>
			<b>Question 02:</b> Do content and form have the correlative dependence of a 'good design'?</p>
