    <h1>Reading Response 7: Jürg Lehni talks with Philippe Cao &amp; Daniel Giuditta</h1>
		<p><b>Question 01:</b> When Jürg Lehni said "Yes of course each tool has an impact on its user. The quote “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us” comes to mind...It felt good to give such a machine, which one could argue has killed the sign painter, a new more friendly meaning." I wonder, in the actual design world, does tool shape the intepretation of the original meaning of the design? 
		       <br>
			<b>Question 02:</b> How does coding shape designer's job?</p>
