    <h1>Reading Response 10: My Website Is a Shifting House... </h1>
		<p><b>Quote 01:</b> <i>"This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works (the objects) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!). Ideally, the two would inform each other in a virtuous, self-perfecting loop. This can be incredibly nurturing to an artist's practice."</i>

			<b>Quote 02:</b> <i>A website can be anything. It doesn't (and probably shouldn't) be an archive of your complete works. That's going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It's imperfect-maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that's the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?</i></p>
