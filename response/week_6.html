    <h1>Reading Response 6: A Note on the Type</h1>
		<p><b>Question 01:</b> Could a font represent its typography designer's aesthetic style and personality? 
		       <br>
			<b>Question 02:</b> The author has mentioned "design was always taken in this "not only...but also" balance. It was as if there were really two very different ways of grasping an object: one through its intrinsic materiality, the other through its more aesthetic or "symbolic" aspects." Is there really two different way of grasping font design?</p>
