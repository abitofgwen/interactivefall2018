    <h1>Reading Response 13: Captives of the Cloud</h1>
		<p>This reading reminded me two things I have read before, the first one was written by a potet and Internet philosopher <a href="https://www.eff.org/john-perry-barlow">John Perry Barlow</a> - <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>. John described a vision of making internet with no boundaries and the freedom of the internet is just important as the freedom of human...The second was written by Nicole Starosielski - <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network">The Undersea Network</a>, it described the infrastructure of our "wireless" world today, and "where the network and the connections it enables are made possible by the deliberate negotiation and manipulation of technology, culture, politics and geography." Just as Captives of the Cloud illustrated, "The internet can be compared to a patchwork of city-states, or an archipelago of islands." the cloud itself remains our existences. </p>
